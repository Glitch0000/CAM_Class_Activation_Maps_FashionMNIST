# CAM_Class_Activation_Maps_FashionMNIST
In this repsitory, we will see how to implement a simple class activation map (CAM) of a model trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset. This will show what parts of the image the model was paying attention to when deciding the class of the image.


The output of the model will show the class actication map as the following:
